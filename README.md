## üßê About <a name="about"></a>
Termux Parrot is an installer script written in Amber that allows you to run Parrot OS within Termux on Android devices. The project aims to provide a seamless way to access Parrot OS tools and environments on mobile devices, with current support for CLI interface and planned extensions for desktop environment access via VNC.

The installer handles the complete setup process, including downloading the appropriate Parrot OS rootfs, verifying its integrity, configuring the environment, and setting up user accounts. It's designed to be user-friendly while maintaining security and stability.
